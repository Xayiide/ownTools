# ownTools
Pentesting and ethical hacking tools I made for myself (for learning purposes mainly)

Inspired by the book: Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers by 
T. J. O'Connor

arpSpoofer:
  This page [https://medium.com/@ismailakkila/black-hat-python-arp-cache-poisoning-with-scapy-7cb1d8b9d242] Gave me an idea on how to format it and how to use the scapy syntax (which isn't very clear on the docs)

netscanner:
  This page helped me with the thread Queue [https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/13683/pinging-a-list-of-hosts]
  fping is used (as it has lower timeout options than ping)
  sudo apt-get install fping

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
